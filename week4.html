                        This week, I learned about Flexbox and how it can be used to format containers and objects in
                        web pages. For this week's blog entry, I was curious on how to make text appear in reverse,
                        as the topic of right-to-left languages was brought up in class. While I am not trying to
                        reverse the order of the words, I am reversing the order of the characters appearing in each line of this
                        text box.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This reminds me of the movie Tenet! Its named after the Sator Square puzzle (which is
                        mentioned throughout the film) where reading the puzzle from the beginning reads the same way
                        as if you read it from the end.

                        Code that allowed me to do this was found from <a
                            href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/12180034">Stack Overflow</a>
                        and described how to use the following unicode encoding tags in HTML to override right-to-left
                        (&/#x202e;) and left-to-right (&/#x202d;) control (ignore the "/"). Notice that I have duplicated
                        the text from this container to the one opposite this page, but the text is reversed!
