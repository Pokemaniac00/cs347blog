        <h3>Week 1 & 2: 08/26/2021 - 09/03/2021</h3>
        <p>My first week and a half of Web Development has given me the opportunity to practice and understand HTML on
            a higher level than when <a href="http://jazzcoding.me">I performed my own personal research to learn
                HTML.</a> I have enjoyed the in-class labs so far, and I wanted to share some of my more recent
            personal research on HTML in this week's blog entry. My HTML files have seen much more structure like in the
            code snippet below (adding a code snippet was also something I researched for this week).
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                &lt;html&gt;
                    &lt;head&gt;
                        &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;
                    &lt;/head&gt;
                    &lt;body&gt;
                        &lt;header&gt;
                            &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to the website!&lt;/h1&gt;
                        &lt;/header&gt;
                        &lt;main&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;psst! Check the browser to see a pacman pizza!&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;Did you know Pacman's original design was inspired from a pizza with a slice taken away?&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/main&gt;
                        &lt;footer&gt;
                            Contact us!
                        &lt;/footer&gt;
                    &lt;/body&gt;
                &lt;/html&gt;
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>The code snippet above was able to be added using encodings for the characters '&lt;' and '&gt;'. These encodings begin with a 
            '&' and are followed up with 'lt;' or 'gt;' depending on which side of bracket you need. This can be useful to teach others about
            HTML from within an HTML page! There are many online converters as well to make the HTML tags readable on pages.
        </p>
        <p>As an added bonus, I looked at how to add favicons to web pages! Take a look above!</p>
