            <p>This week, I was introduced to CSS to stylize my websites. Notice the change in the overall layout of my
                blog and my blog article since my first post. CSS has already proven to be a very useful tool,
                allowing me to perform simple tasks such as <a class="demo">changing the color, border, or font of
                    text</a> or even add shadows behind images, such as the one above.</p>

            <p>This week, my personal research led me to find some uses for CSS outside of the uses
                mentioned in the textbook. I decided to demonstrate the use of CSS to apply filters
                to images. Check this out below!
            </p>
            <center><img class="filtered" src="http://jazzcoding.me/Pizza-Website/images/pacmanpizza.jpeg"></center>
            <p>Notice how I applied a blur and greyscale filter to the image from the top of the webpage.
                This could be a very useful tool for creating a web application to apply filters to uploaded images.
