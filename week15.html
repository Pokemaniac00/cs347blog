                If I were to teach CS347 next fall, I would slightly change the pacing in the course to spend less time
                on HTML, and more time on CSS, JS, node.js, and react JS. I appreciated the introduction to web
                development and design through HTML/CSS, but once we hit JS, I felt like the class took off at a much
                faster pace than before. Additionally, the way the labs and readings were lining up, I felt like I
                didn't have the full knowledge necessary to complete project 2 until the class before. Also, once we
                made it to project 3 material, I feel like I personally have struggled with understanding React. I feel
                like the course could be improved by having some class lectures and downloadable code samples, instead
                of having to copy code from the book to see how it works offline. Having these resources could be a
                benefit to help students understand how these programming languages work. Also, to make the labs more
                interactive, maybe in the last 10-15 minutes of class, the groups could come together to help come to a
                general consensus of the purpose of the lab and some ways to solve it, which could help students that
                struggled on labs (especially if the lab is a part 1 that leads to a part 2 the next class). Overall, I
                enjoyed this course, and I knew I would. However, once we made it to React JS material, I became very
                lost.
